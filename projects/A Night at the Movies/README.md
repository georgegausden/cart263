Harry Potter!

The point of this project was to try to create an interactive game that uses the
Annyang voice recognition library. The game consists of two games; a quidditch match
as well as a potions class. The user needs to say specific spells such as 'Wingardium Leviosa'
and 'Lumos' to activate certain functions in the code which are reflected in the game.

For me, this project was very ambitious. I think I took on a lot of work in terms of creating
different features in the game. For example, I started looking briefly into how the enemy players could have a strategy in the quidditch match. There are quite a lot of sound effects
and music tracks I added to make the game feel more interactive (the music in particular made
me feel very nostalgic).

One of the main goals for this project personally was to stay very organized in my code. I think I can say I achieved that by using multiple files and creating lots of comments everywhere.

I do wish I spent more time on the aesthetics of the project. I think the program definitely would have benefited from custom made image assets. Initially, I also wanted to use the ML5 handpose library for the potions class game. I tested using ML5 and Annyang simultaneously, but my computer struggled a lot and the frame rate was too low for the game to be enjoyable.
