Harry Potter!

The point of this project was to try to create an interactive game that uses the
Annyang voice recognition library. The project consists of two games; a quidditch match
as well as a potions class.

In the quidditch match, the user needs to score 5 points by guiding their wizard to the golden snitch and then passing through one of the three hoops. It's also possible to cast an immobilizing spell on the enemy players by pressing the mouse in their direction.

In the potions class, the user needs to find the correct mix of potions to place in the couldron. This game makes use of a JSON file by displaying the type of potion to create as well as what it does in the bottom center of the canvas. The user also needs to make use of the Annyang voice library by saying 'Wingardium Leviosa' while placing their wand on a potion to make it levitate. The music tends to get louder so you might have to yell these spells out loud for the program to properly understand you.

For me, this project was very ambitious. I think I took on a lot of work in terms of creating
different features in the game. For example, I started looking briefly into how the enemy players could have a strategy in the quidditch match. There are quite a lot of sound effects
and music tracks I added to make the game feel more interactive (doing research to find music in particular made me feel very nostalgic).

One of the main goals for this project personally was to stay very organized in my code. I think I can say I achieved that by using multiple files and creating lots of comments everywhere. I'm also really happy I was able to deal with some vector problems which I wasn't able to figure out on my last final project. In my last project I wasn't able to normalize the velocity vectors of projectiles, but I figured it out this time!

I wish I spent more time on the aesthetics of the project. I think the program definitely would have benefited from custom made image assets. Initially, I also wanted to use the ML5 handpose library for the potions class game. I tested using ML5 and Annyang simultaneously, but my computer struggled a lot and the frame rate was too low for the game to be enjoyable. I also just ran into an issue when trying to run the program online and use a Harry Potter font! So sadly, it won't look as authentic as I'd hoped.

Credits:
  -The music is all imported from Youtube and is the original soundtracks of from different Harry Potter films.
  -Some parts of code were imported from different p5 sketches I found online. They should be referenced in my files in the comments.
  -The image assets were all found on Google Images.
  -The sound effects were also found on Youtube, although most of them were trimmed and edited for them to make sense in my program.

Enjoy!
