The Planets!

The main focus of my project was to create an interactive solar system model that is partly randomly generated (using random sizes for planets, random landscapes and moons) but that relies on some user input to determine how many planets and suns they would like. The user experience was intended to be calming.

I think I achieved the goal of having a calming user experience from the use of smooth transitions between camera states to the way the user is transported to the solar system they select. Additionally, I think the addition of the background music I made in Logic Pro really adds to this experience of sereneness and gives a space-like atmosphere to the simulation.

I did actually have plans to create more elements in the solar system such as planet rings as well as different atmospheres for each planet using different 3d shapes but those plans fell through mainly because performance became an issue. I also found that after a while I hit a brick wall with the basic 3D shapes using p5 WEBGL's basic library. Since I had already advanced a lot in my project by the time I wanted to implement planet rings and clouds/atmospheres I thought it would be really difficult to try to use a different 3D library given that I already had set up all my other shapes and functions using p5's WEBGL library.

There are some issues that I would've liked to resolve but I couldn't find any helpful solution to. For example, the camera using the easyCam library seems to have a max rendering distance that I could not find a way to change. This results in dark spots when viewing the solar system from a certain angle and distance. Also, the program has some glitches when going from one planet to another using the right arrow key. These are some of the aspects which I think could be improved upon if I were to make a more advanced version of this project.

I hope you enjoy the result!
